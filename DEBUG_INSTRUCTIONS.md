   ```

2. **Reload extension** and test with debug panel

3. **The debug panel will show:**

   - âœ… Full analysis flow testing

### Common Issues & Solutions:

1. **"No reviews found"** â†’ Make sure you're on a product page with reviews
2. **Backend connection error** â†’ Ensure backend server is running on port 8000

### What Was Fixed:

- âœ… Added comprehensive debug logging
